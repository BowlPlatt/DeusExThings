(This is Deus Ex On Hit/On Death Soundbites, but renamed due to the addition of the GEP Gun.)
"GET OUT OF HERE, DENTON!"

This was the last straw. JC WHIPPED out his PROD (stick with it), and lunged forward, aiming at Simons' center mass. 
But Simons, with his updated firmware, was too fast. In a millisecond, he had his Stealth Pistol out, and Tricky-one-tapped (TM of Tricky Pope) JC's face.
"YEAAAAAARRRRRGGGH-GAH!"

The 6 laws
1. Never disgrace the Derpfish
2. Always treat explosions and water with most respect
3. When ever you see a brony or a squeaker, contain yourself to the point of which you can no longer
4. Never beg for items unless you are on the verge of bankruptcy
5. Lastly, never ever ever ever disgrace thy mama
6. When using high-damage weapon combos that can kill players without them even getting a chance, remember to always tie the noose correctly.
